# Sitemap URL Extractor Tool

I built this tool to get a list of all of the URL's in a sitemap as i use it farily often for projects to understand the lis to URL's. 

All you have to do is go to a sitemap.xml, copy the entire page in your browser (ctrl+c) and paste it in the tool below. 

This tool allows you to export to CSV, copy in browser a specific URL or ALL URL's

* note - sometimes you need to add view-source:SITEMAPURL to get the copy from your browser.
