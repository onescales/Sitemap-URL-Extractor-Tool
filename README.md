# Sitemap URL Extractor Tool

I built this tool to get a list of all of the URL's in a sitemap as i use it farily often for projects to understand the lis to URL's. 

All you have to do is go to a sitemap.xml, copy the entire page in your browser and paste it in the tool below. 

* note - sometimes you need to add view-source:SITEMAPURL to get the copy from your browser.
